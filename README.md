## Overview

The challenge was to implement a simple QR Code to a webpage using HTML and CSS properties, trying to implement the original template layout as closely as possible

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Even tough I'm somewhat familiar with HTML and CSS, understanding styling with positions, flexboxes and grid still
aren't that clear to me, so I still have some trouble adjusting containers and boxes to fit accordinly to the given layouts. This also can make the mobile-first workflow easier. So understanding and studing better how flexbox and grid works, as long as how the elements should be written
in the HTML, should be one of my goals.
